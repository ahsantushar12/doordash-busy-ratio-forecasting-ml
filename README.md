# 🔢 Busy Ratio Prediction for Food Delivery using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the **busy_ratio** of restaurants in a food delivery network using historical restaurant, dasher, and order data. Multiple regression models were evaluated, including Lasso Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.

---

## 📌 Objective

Predict the **busy_ratio** — a metric representing how busy a restaurant is — using engineered features such as:
- EMA/SMA indicators
- Dasher activity logs
- Store and time-based encodings
- Price range and item count

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains over **138,000 training records**, with validation and test sets of ~29,600 records each. Extensive feature engineering and selection were performed before modeling.

---

## ⚙️ Techniques Used

- Feature Engineering (EMA, SMA, EMA_diff, SMA_diff, log transformations)
- Feature Selection (XGBoost importance, Lasso regularization)
- Cross-validation (5-fold and 10-fold)
- Regression Modeling (Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost)
- Evaluation (RMSE, R²)
- Visualization (Feature importance, residuals)
